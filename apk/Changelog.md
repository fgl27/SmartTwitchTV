* Add back all performance improves and features of Apk Version 3.0.260 but this time without any device incompatibility and with even better performance gain
* Addressed all problems discovered on Apk Version 3.0.260 plus also addressed old reported or discovered problems, it problem that was fix or at least mitigate is on the bellow lines
* Re-organized settings order, clean up some strings
* Add new Settings **Auto quality Blocked resolutions** this is to address the issue that some devices have with some resolutions as the Xiaomi Mi Box S and 9XXp resolution problem, this issue was already informed to Xiaomi see bellow issue list and probably on next update from they it will be fixed, but as this maybe a issue on the Amlogic Codecs this is a good feature to have, as there is a lot of TV device that use Amlogic and may never get updates
* Add new Settings **Auto quality maximum allowed Resolution/Bitrate** this new settings allows to control more then the old option that only allowed Bitrate control, with this device that was lagging on the past playing multiple streams have more control and can mitigate the lags
* Setting is no longer necessary to enable **Multiplayer mode old OS workaround** for most device (probably all), so it comes disabled by default on all devices, if you need this on yours device send a email (contact info in the about), this option when enable may cause lag on some devices so only use if you really needed
* Prevent flicker green screen on NVIDIA SHIELD, I only have the 2017 darcy model but this probably prevent on all models, this issue is better described bellow
* Bellow are the list of issue and discussion that I have started in order to addressed all device specific issue that I know the app has, again this are device specific so only some unlucky user are affected, the goal her is to find a solution on the device side that is why I have started the bellow discussion so the Manufacturer get informed.
* [Xiaomi Mi Box S: 90% frame drops on 9XXp60 but OK for 1080p60](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7411) issue closed the resolution there is that the Manufacturer will update the OS to fix the problem, the problem is on the this device maybe on others that use Amlogic CPU
* [Xiaomi Mi Box S: Error when changing PP mode causing too long buffers](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7996) issue open, the problem was mitigate on the app side, but this error may occurs and cause long buffer for the user, the problem is on the Amlogic codec the goal of the discussion is reach a conclusion and inform the Manufacturer to fix the problem
* [NVIDIA SHIELD flicker green screen](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7998), issue open, the problem here is only on streams that use **Rec._709 color profile**, was possible to prevent the issue from happening on almost all situations, but randomly it may happen when this happens isn't possible for the app to detect, so to fix after you notice it just restart the player, if playing a single video just change the quality to the same (press enter in the quality control option), if playing multiple streams just restart the problematic stream (Using the controls restart, choose the affected stream only), the goal of the discussion is reach a conclusion and inform the Manufacturer to fix the problem
* [Amazon Fire Stick Gen 2: visual glitches when playing multiple streams](https://github.com/fgl27/SmartTwitchTV/issues/13), this issue has not yet a full fix, if you try any type of multiple stream options one or all video may have visual glitches, as this is a very old device there may not be a solution only mitigation.
* On future app updates I'll update on the resolution of this issues

* Add new feature [Channels on the home screen](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/discovery/recommendations-channel) added Live, User Live, Featured, Games and User games home screen channels, the channels only show up after the new app is installed and open
* **Obs.1:** This featuring is only available on AndroidTV 8 Oreo and newer OS
* **Obs.2:** Technically this featuring is just a simpler version of the in app implementation of previews over the player, but this works from the home screen and has way less features than the in app player one, this is the main reason it wasn't added before, after all the app has a way easier and better form to navigate and find what to play next...
* **Obs.3:** With the in app preview one can simply press up that is it press up noting else, and you will be able to navigate on the preview and find what play next, not just that before press enter to play if you have preview enable you can see the preview and see what is going on on the stream, so in a easy step of just pressing up then right/left one can find the next content on the other hand using the **Channels on the home screen** is very different...
* **Obs.4:** Now with the **Channels on the home screen** yes one can exclusively navigate from the home channels to the app and back for in one click, but how? Open a stream or game from a channel by pressing enter now if you wanna open something else from home, just click the home key (not the return key) this will send you back to the channel now select something else... But be aware that the process of exiting the app and going back to the app is much but much more slower then just press up and click enter on the player preview to open a new stream, simply because you are exiting the app and the process of exiting a app causes a lot of Android internal function calls and those will cost time to process a time that is 5 to 10 times bigger then opening something from the in the app preview. Any way **Channels on the home screen** is a AndroidTV featuring that was requested by users as I had some free time I could take a couple of hours of it to make add this featuring, enjoy it.
