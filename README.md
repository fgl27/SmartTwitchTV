SmartTwitchTV
==============

This is an WIP web application designed to watch Twitch.tv broadcasts on SmartTV's , A good official Twitch.TV app is not available for most devices, that is way this project exist.

The intention of this is to make a web app that runs on all modern browser and can be easily ported to any OS that can run a web app's.

What is be worked on:

* Finishing porting the web UI from TizenOS to any browser
* Finishing making a android app to run this web UI
* On that android app make a good player, the android basic player is be used for testing it works, but is too basic
* This will probably be release on play in late 2019 early 2020
* If anyone wanna help email (find it on my git profile) or [open a issue](https://github.com/fgl27/SmartTwitchTV/issues/new/choose)

This project is a port of this repo [smarttv-twitch](https://github.com/fgl27/smarttv-twitch) using separated repo to make easier use of github pages and commit history

About this fork
===============

I initially fork this from https://github.com/CazuzaCzz/SmartTwitchTV/commits/tizen
The original fork is https://github.com/nikitakatchik/SmartTwitchTV

I have started this project because the above Repos of the app did not fully support my TV model, it had many bugs and the app did not had all Twitch.TV featuring like a more complete users interface (For VOD, Cips, basic Channel off line content, Chat and etc related) it also didn't fully support the latest version of Samsung smart remote.

So I start this new repo keep the original name and commit history, work a long time writing this a new application basically from scratch focusing on performance and all available Twitch.TV featuring, with the help of some users reporting bugs and making featuring request, I add many features and work to resolve all the bugs, today the application is very complete, can be easily used to watch all available Twitch.TV content and give the user a lot of extra options, but is know that the application can be always improved, new featuring and improves are always in the works, mostly to give a better experience and more options to the user, but as today there is only one main developer working on this project the process is slow, but fell free to report bugs and make request, for that use the [open a issue option of this repo](https://github.com/fgl27/SmartTwitchTV/issues/new/choose).
